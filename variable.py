# variable in python

"""
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

"""
x=5         # x is a variable of int type
y="hello"   # y is a variable of string type

z='yash'    # String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
X=7     # Variable names are case-sensitive.

print(type(x))
print(y)
print(z)
print(X)
